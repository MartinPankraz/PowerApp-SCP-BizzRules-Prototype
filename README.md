# PowerApp-SCP-BizzRules-Prototype
Repos containing Microsoft PowerAutomate flows, SCP Business Rules Project and PowerApp template.

![Overview_Image](https://github.com/MartinPankraz/PowerApp-SCP-BizzRules-Prototype/blob/master/pictures/sales-use-case-overview.png)

The project consists of a powerapp "Project X", a SAP SCP Business Rules project "SalesQuotes_SAP_BizzRules.zip" and three PowerAutomate flows "GenerateQuoteEmail.zip","SCP-BusinessRules-GET-Deal-Eligiblity.zip" and "UpdateCommissionOnSCPBizRules.zip".

I added placeholders "<<<>>>" on the definitions files for you to configure with your own values.
