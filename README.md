# PowerApp-SCP-BizzRules-Prototype
Repos containing Microsoft PowerAutomate flows, SCP Business Rules Project and PowerApp template

I added placeholders "<<<>>>" on the definitions files for you to configure with your own values.

The project consists of a powerapp "Project X", a SAP SCP Business Rules project "SalesQuotes_SAP_BizzRules.zip" and three PowerAutomate flows "GenerateQuoteEmail.zip","SCP-BusinessRules-GET-Deal-Eligiblity.zip" and "UpdateCommissionOnSCPBizRules.zip".
